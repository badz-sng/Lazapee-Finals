    <h1>Quick Hummus Recipe</h1>
    <p>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years. Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greak and Middle Eastern Dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meat and pitta bread.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Can(400mg) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
        <li>175g of tahini</li>
        <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
        <li>Half a red pepper</li>
        <li>A pintch of cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
        <li>A dash of olive oil</li>    
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove the skin of the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
        <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
        <li>Add all the Ingredients into a food processor</li>
        <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste
            <ul>
                <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</li>
                <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>For a different flabour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemmon and coriander, chilli pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you</em></p>
    <h3>Storage</h3>
    <p>Refrigirate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should difinitely discard it.</p>
    <p>Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw is and use it within a couple of months</p>
